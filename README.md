# Hackathon Server
  Server side code for a carpool app, that I wrote during HackTJ.
  Not extremeley useful yet, but a good, flexible reference, for node,
  express, and couchdb. I might finish it up one day, but that day isn't near.

## Contributions
  Every single line of code here was written by me. I didn't include the 
  frontend, because two other people worked on that, and I'll leave it up to 
  them to publish the code (if they choose to).
